<h2>What is Kvinto?</h2>
Exclusively engaged in overhaul, manufacture and sale of car radiators, heating, air conditioning, intercoolers and oil coolers for all types of cars and trucks, buses, motorcycles, veterans, agricultural machinery and special construction machinery. Kvinto, a limited liability company, was founded in December 1992 by five companies (hence the name), as a successor of associated production for repairs of car radiators ZD Mříčná. They have been repairing car radiators here since 1969. Two of the company's founding members were in one of the co-production. From the beginning, the company's activities were focused mainly on overhauls of radiators for buses and trucks of domestic types such as KAROSA and LIAZ. Over time, with the ever-evolving business in road transport and the expansion of the import of used cars, we have begun repairs and foreign types of radiators, including the assembly of new radiators for both trucks and utility and passenger cars.

<h2>Old "Logo"</h2>
To date, this company has had no corporate identity, no logo, promotional materials, etc.
Even though they have been on the market for 20 years. The only thing the company used was this graphically processed text, which told the customer what the company was focusing on.

<h2>New Logo</h2>
I tried to incorporate three elements into the logo. Cold, heat and repairs
I created metaphors
<li>Cold = snow</li>
<li>Heat = flame</li>
<li>Repairs = tools</li>

<h2>Sketching</h2>

<h2>Final</h2>
The logo consists of three elements:
<li>Flame – heat</li>
<li>Snowflake – cold</li>
<li>Tools - repairs</li>
