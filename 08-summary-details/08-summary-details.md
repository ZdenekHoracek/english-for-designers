<h1>Corporate identity</h1>
 My thesis is on the topic of corporate identity and I do a visual identity for a small company in the Czech Republic, for Kvinto
 <h2>Kvinto</h2>


<h2>What is Kvinto?</h2>
Exclusively engaged in overhaul, manufacture and sale of car radiators, heating, air conditioning, intercoolers and oil coolers for all types of cars and trucks, buses, motorcycles, veterans, agricultural machinery and special construction machinery. Kvinto, a limited liability company, was founded in December 1992 by five companies (hence the name), as a successor of associated production for repairs of car radiators Mříčná. They have been repairing car radiators here since 1969. Two of the company's founding members were in one of the co-production. From the beginning, the company's activities were focused mainly on overhauls of radiators for buses and trucks of domestic types such as KAROSA and LIAZ. Over time, with the ever-evolving business in road transport and the expansion of the import of used cars, we have begun repairs and foreign types of radiators, including the assembly of new radiators for both trucks and utility and passenger cars.

<h2>Old "Logo"</h2>
To date, this company has had no corporate identity, no logo, promotional materials, etc.
Even though they have been on the market for 20 years. The only thing the company used was this graphically processed text, which told the customer what the company was focusing on.

Here you can see an old business card that the company has been using for over 20 years. Business card design was often used as billboards

Kvinto has never used any promotion in the form of printed materials.

<h2>New Logo</h2>
I tried to incorporate three elements into the logo. Cold, heat and repairs
I created metaphors
<li>Cold = snow</li>
<li>Heat = flame</li>
<li>Repairs = tools</li>

<h2>Sketching</h2>
In sketching, I tried to combine elements in different ways to create the most ideal variant. 
Here you can see my steps in sketching

<h2>Final</h2>
The logo consists of three elements:
<li>Flame – heat</li>
<li>Snowflake – cold</li>
<li>Tools - repairs</li>

The font used for the company name in the logo is Mic 32 New in bold style. The priority when choosing a logo was to maintain the seriousness and compatibility with the logo.

<h2>Visual identity</h2>
 
 The graphic element consists of the letter N and forms a sample of the car cooler. This pattern forms the basis for printed matter. The visual identity is made up of two basic colors, black and yellow. The graphic element acts as a background pattern. The goal was to create a clean and clear design that will be easy to remember.
