# Zdeněk Horáček
Graphic designer. I'm a perfectionist. I like minimalism and clean design. Every thing is an inspiration to me.

I was born in Czech small city in the mountains, Jilemnice. In my free time I play ice hockey . I like walking around the mountains,where I look for inspiration. I like to spend time with friends at the cottage .  As graphic designer, I like to entertain people with graphic photomontages.
