<h2>Slide 1</h2>
Hi, my name is Zdeněk Horáček and the topic of my bachelor thesis is Corporate Identity.

<h2>Slide 2</h2>
For the practical part of my work, I chose the company called Kvinto

<h2>Slide 3</h2>
The company is engaged in overhaul, manufacture and sale car radiators, heating, air conditioning, intercoolers and oil coolers for all types of cars and trucks, buses, motorcycles, veterans, agricultural machinery and special construction machinery.
Although the company has been on the market for almost 30 years, they have never used any visual identity.

<h2>Slide 4</h2>
Kvinto hasn’t had a logo yet. They used only a typographic mark. Here you can see the old design that Kvinto has presented itself in the past.

<h2>Slide 5</h2>
The company used only business cards like promotional material. Here you can see the old business card design.

<h2>Slide 6</h2>
Here you can see the websites that the company uses.

<h2>Slide 7</h2>
Like a first step of creating corporate design, I was focused on the new logo.

<h2>Slide 8</h2>
• I tried to incorporate three elements into the logo. Cold, heat and repairs
• I created metaphors
Cold = snow 
Heat = flame 
Repairs = tools 

<h2>Slide 9</h2>
Here is my mood board. First, I dealt with the stylization of individual elements.

<h2>Slide 10</h2>
Here you can see the first workspace, where I put together ideas and stylizations of individual elements and tried to combine them.

<h2>Slide 11</h2>
Here you can see a selection of the style the company wanted to follow and its development into the final form of the logo.

<h2>Slide 12</h2>
Now let's look at the final logo of the Kvinto company.

<h2>Slide 13</h2>
On the left picture you can see the final logotype and pictograms of the elements from which the logo is formed.
On the right picture you can see how the logo is aligned in circular shapes.

<h2>Slide 14</h2>
I also focused on choosing a font that will represent the name of the Kvinto company.

<h2>Slide 15</h2>
I chose the font Mic 32 new for the logo.
On the left you can see the finished logo with the name of the company.

<h2>Slide 16</h2>
Colours

<h2>Slide 17</h2>
The logo and the entire visual identity are made up of two basic colours. Yellow and black. Here you can see the individual values for the colour modes.

<h2>Slide 18</h2>
Visual identity 

<h2>Slide 19</h2>
For visual identity, I created a graphic element, which is formed from the letter N and symbolizes the pattern of the car cooler. (professionally they’re called Honeycombs?). The graphic element will work as a background texture for the entire visual identity.

<h2>Slide 20</h2>
Application of visual identity to printed matter.

<h2>Slide 21</h2>
This is what individual mercantile prints look like. All printed matter is created in the same style of visual identity.

<h2>Slide 22</h2>
Here is the design of presentation boards

<h2>Slide 23</h2>
Here you can see the design of the letterhead. The graphic element in the background reappears here. It’s yellow with a slight opacity so as not to disturb the text.

<h2>Slide 24</h2>
Here are mail envelopes which are re-created in the same style.


<h2>Slide 25</h2>
Here is the design of double-sided business cards. On the front there is a logo on a dark background made of a graphic element. On the back is a large inscription car cooler, air conditioning, tire service and the most important contacts.

<h2>Slide 26</h2>
Here you can see promotional leaflets where are written an information about the company. The text on leaflets is supplemented by specific pictures and photos.

<h2>Slide 27</h2>
Orientation system

<h2>Slide 28</h2>
Here you see the individual signs of the orientation system. On the top left you can see signs that are applied to the door, below them are individual signs that appear at the door to the office, workshop, dining room, etc. On the right are signs that direct drivers to the company building.

<h2>Slide 29</h2>
