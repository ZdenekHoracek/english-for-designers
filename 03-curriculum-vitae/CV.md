<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Graphic designer. I'm a perfectionist. Everything is an inspiration to me.

I was born in Jilemnice, a small Czech
city in the mountains. In my free time
I play ice hockey, spend time with friends at the cottage, and take walks around the 
mountains, where I look for inspiration. >
